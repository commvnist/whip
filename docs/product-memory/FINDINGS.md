# Durable findings

### FND-20260831-001 — Configurable behavior lacked its prerequisite control

- Severity/category: P0 control integrity and domain correctness.
- Observed: Ordinary routines could select `% Training Max` while the required Training Max was hidden or unconfigurable.
- Expected: Every exposed mode has a discoverable, valid path to configure its prerequisites before Save.
- Why it matters: General strength users could create invalid or misleading prescriptions.
- Evidence: `RoutineBuilder.kt`; `RoutineRepository.kt`; detailed evidence in `../GYM_531_PRODUCT_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`.
- Root cause: UI capability and persisted domain requirements evolved separately.
- Resolution: Place Training Max controls before dependent sets, support explicit/derived sources, validate missing estimates, and replace stale child data transactionally.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-002 — Adaptive layout and navigation lost routine context

- Severity/category: P1 mobile UX and navigation.
- Observed: A fixed nested exercise viewport was too small; exercise Save could return to the library root; an early remedy expanded routine content unexpectedly.
- Expected: Editors use available screen/pane space and selection returns to the initiating routine/day.
- Why it matters: Mobile and foldable users could see one exercise at a time and repeatedly reconstruct context.
- Evidence: `WhipApp.kt`, `RoutineBuilder.kt`, `RoutineBuilderUiTest.kt`; screenshots linked by the detailed Gym audit.
- Root cause: The support pane was treated as a generic fixed container and picker navigation did not preserve an explicit return target.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34; subjective device validation remains ongoing.

### FND-20260831-003 — Optional-policy toggles regenerated unrelated prescriptions

- Severity/category: P1 authored-data preservation.
- Observed: Toggling Joker policy could regenerate Main/Supplemental work and overwrite custom details; Joker could appear to compete with ending work.
- Expected: Joker is additive Optional work and cannot mutate BBB/FSL/SSL/BBS/custom Supplemental work.
- Evidence: `RoutineBuilderState.setFiveThreeOneJokerEnabled`; `RoutineBuilderStateTest` additive-preservation regressions.
- Root cause: A broad phase-regeneration path was used for a narrow optional-feature change.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-004 — Rest-timer display could exceed selected duration

- Severity/category: P1 in-gym trust and boundary correctness.
- Observed: A fresh five-minute deadline could render 5:01 before reaching 5:00.
- Expected: Selected duration is an authoritative upper display bound; first elapsed second is 4:59.
- Evidence: Timer calculation tests and the adaptive training section of `../GYM_531_PRODUCT_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`.
- Root cause: Ceiling deadline arithmetic observed a newer persisted deadline with a stale UI clock tick.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-005 — Active-workout customization could mutate program meaning

- Severity/category: P1 history and progression integrity.
- Observed: Ad-hoc set/exercise additions risked becoming planned Main work or altering the source routine.
- Expected: Workout-only work is explicit Optional/ad-hoc content, persists with the session and history, and leaves future routine prescriptions unchanged.
- Evidence: `GymRepository`, `WhipApp.kt`, `FirstClassWorkflowE2ETest.kt`, repository regressions.
- Root cause: Template prescriptions and session-instance customization were insufficiently separated.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-006 — Product knowledge was fragmented across chats and dated audits

- Severity/category: P1 process reliability and cross-session continuity.
- Observed: Many useful audit reports existed, but there was no canonical current index, stable issue linkage, or required writeback protocol.
- Expected: Every substantial task begins from and ends by updating concise repository-backed memory, while code remains authoritative.
- Why it matters: Future agents could repeat investigations, forget user corrections, overclaim verification, or regress accepted decisions.
- Root cause: Documentation was report-oriented rather than lifecycle-oriented.
- Resolution: Personal `maintain-whip-memory` skill, workspace instructions, canonical ledgers, stable IDs, and a goal with mandatory memory checkpoints.
- Status: Implemented; effectiveness must be validated through future tasks.

### FND-20260831-007 — Failed restore recovery allowed normal startup to continue

- Severity/category: P0 data integrity and recovery.
- Observed: `WhipApplication.onCreate` discarded `recoverIfNeeded` failure, then initialized normal repositories, a default Area, scheduling, Health work, and widgets.
- Expected: An unresolved recovery marker blocks every normal write-capable path until Retry succeeds.
- Why it matters: New work can compound mixed state or later disappear when rollback succeeds.
- Evidence: `WhipApplication.kt`, `RestoreRecoveryManager.kt`, and `../WHOLE_PRODUCT_MAXIMUM_QUALITY_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`.
- Root cause: Atomic restore recovery was treated as best-effort startup housekeeping, and write-capable workers, receivers, widgets, schedulers, Activity-scoped drafts, and live restore were not governed by one application-wide maintenance boundary.
- Resolution: A counted application data-access barrier now denies late work and drains admitted work before replace restore. Pending recovery, live restore, rollback, runtime rebuilding, WorkManager startup, workers, receivers, widgets, schedulers, ViewModels, SavedState drafts/imports, notification actions, and widget entity references share fail-closed generation-aware rules. Recovery failure presents an accessible blocking screen with Retry and preserves the recovery marker; historical databases and completed records are not recomputed.
- Status: Resolved and verified on the disposable emulator; see `IMP-20260831-004` and `VER-20260831-006`.

### FND-20260831-008 — Reminder delivery trusts stale queued work

- Severity/category: P1 correctness and user trust.
- Observed: Task, Habit, and Goal workers do not all re-resolve the exact current occurrence, configuration, schedule version, and pause/skip/completion state immediately before posting.
- Expected: Missing or stale delivery targets fail closed; valid current targets still notify and schedule the next occurrence.
- Why it matters: Obsolete prompts teach reminder-dependent and ADHD users to ignore Whip.
- Affected users: recurring Task users, every Habit/Goal reminder user, source-backed Habit users, travelers, users editing near delivery, and users acting from the notification shade.
- Root cause: queued WorkManager inputs were treated as authority; delivery/action rules were split across schedulers and presentation paths; cancellation was not awaited; mutable source/history/settings state lacked one final linearization boundary; and deletion crossed Room/NotificationManager without durable cleanup intent.
- Resolution: Every Task/Habit/Goal request now carries a versioned exact claim containing stable identity, logical day, trigger, kind, and deterministic definition fingerprint. Workers and actions resolve live domain state immediately before posting/mutation, fail closed on malformed or stale input, distinguish scheduled/snoozed/optional work, and reconcile current future work. A non-reentrant state boundary linearizes production repository commits with resolve/post while explicit raw composition and entity→state lock order avoid Room/deadlock traps. Quiet/time-zone writes and full-snapshot settings writes are serialized; source-backed Habit invalidation is bounded; legacy queues are rebuilt once; system time broadcasts reconcile the relevant schedules; and a durable deletion-cleanup journal bridges Room commit with visible-notification/work cleanup across rollback or process death.
- Compatibility: No Room schema or backup-format change. Historical occurrences, completed records, saved logical dates, custom units, and restored data remain unchanged; legacy unverifiable work is canceled/rebuilt rather than accepted.
- Evidence: `ReminderDeliveryClaims.kt`, `CoordinatedReminderRepositories.kt`, `ReminderDeletionCleanupStore.kt`, `ReminderWorker.kt`, `ReminderScheduler.kt`, `HabitReminderScheduler.kt`, `GoalReminderScheduler.kt`, `ReminderActionReceiver.kt`, `ReminderRuntimeMaintenance.kt`, `ReminderTimeChangeReceiver.kt`, `WhipApplication.kt`, and focused JVM/Android regression suites.
- Status: Resolved and verified on the disposable emulator; see `IMP-20260831-005` and `VER-20260831-007`.

### FND-20260831-009 — Time and logical-date semantics diverge from configured Whip time

- Severity/category: P1 date/time correctness.
- Observed: Follow-device zone changes do not reschedule work; Tracks can retain yesterday without a repository emission; Search and elapsed Goal detail use the system zone directly.
- Expected: One explicit active zone/current-date flow controls live behavior while saved historical dates remain immutable.
- Evidence: `WhipApplication.kt`, `AppSettings.kt`, `TrackViewModel.kt`, `UnifiedSearchDialog.kt`, `GymRepository.kt`, `GymScreens.kt`, `GoalViewModel.kt`, `GoalScreens.kt`, `ReminderTimeChangeReceiver.kt`, and focused JVM/Android regressions.
- Resolution: `DATE_CHANGED`, `TIME_SET`, and `TIMEZONE_CHANGED` enter one serialized receiver path; one application-scoped calendar context now carries active zone, physical date, cutoff-adjusted logical date, cutoff, and follow-device policy. Task, Habit, Goal, Track, Search, Gym, and widgets consume it; the root holds the last coherent cross-domain snapshot until every projection catches up. Search completion dates use the Whip zone; Track rolls without repository writes; new/default/copied Gym and Measurement records snapshot explicit current provenance while historical instants/dates remain unchanged. Every elapsed-Goal surface receives the same live clock and Whip zone. Editors/reset dialogs freeze their opening zone and canonical instant, reject nonexistent DST times, require an explicit occurrence for overlaps, and preserve seconds/milliseconds until wall time is deliberately edited.
- Status: Resolved, fully regression-tested, and independently challenged in `IMP-20260831-006`, `IMP-20260831-007`, and `VER-20260831-009`; integrated physical-device release remains deferred with the larger goal.

### FND-20260831-010 — Productivity saves can change Area scope before persistence succeeds

- Severity/category: P1 navigation and state integrity.
- Observed: Task, Habit, and Goal save paths reconcile Area visibility before asynchronous Save confirms success.
- Expected: Scope and success notices change only in the confirmed-success branch; failure retains draft and context.
- Why it matters: A failed or interrupted write could look successful, move the user away from their working context, lose a deep draft, or invite a duplicate retry after the entity had already committed.
- Affected users: Task, Habit, and Goal authors; filtered-Area users; keyboard and one-handed users; users on unreliable storage or during process/activity lifecycle changes.
- Root cause: Navigation, global operation feedback, repository commit, reminder/tag follow-up, and editor dismissal were connected by callbacks without a typed request-owned commit boundary.
- Resolution: Authored definition editors now own UUID-scoped outcomes. They block Back, pointer, and hardware-key editing while saving; retain draft, scroll, and Area on retryable failure; and reconcile Area/dismissal only from their exact confirmed receipt. Repository commit is an explicit point of no return, so ordinary reread/tag/reminder failures become warnings rather than duplicate-producing failures. Receipts re-read authoritative Area, fall back to All Areas if it cannot be verified, atomically reject concurrent or unconsumed requests, reclaim stale terminal delivery, and preserve fatal-error/cancellation semantics.
- Evidence: `AppRuntime.kt`, `AreaScope.kt`, `ProductivityEditorComponents.kt`, `TaskViewModel.kt`, `HabitViewModel.kt`, `GoalViewModel.kt`, `WhipApp.kt`, `TaskEditorDialog.kt`, `HabitScreens.kt`, `GoalScreens.kt`, `EntitySaveCoordinatorUiTest.kt`, and `EntitySaveViewModelIntegrationTest.kt`.
- Status: Resolved for Task/Habit/Goal authored definition editors and verified on the disposable emulator; see `IMP-20260831-008` and `VER-20260831-010`. Adjacent secondary mutation dialogs remain `FND-20260831-019`.

### FND-20260831-011 — Large text removes every visible primary navigation label

- Severity/category: P1 accessibility and navigation.
- Observed: At font scale 1.5 the compact phone navigation becomes six icon-only destinations; screenshots are in `artifacts/full-product-audit/2026-08-31/baseline/`.
- Expected: A measured named row, stable two-row named layout, or labeled drawer preserves visible destination names.
- Affected users: Sighted low-vision, cognitive/ADHD, first-time, and narrow-landscape users.
- Evidence: `WhipApp.kt`, `large-text-home.png`, `large-text-gym.png`.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-012 — Basic Habit creation exposes advanced schedule machinery

- Severity/category: P1 creation UX and executive-function accessibility.
- Observed: Reminder overrides, end conditions, and week-boundary configuration remain in the ordinary path even when advanced controls are meant to stay folded.
- Expected: A visible reminder summary and progressively disclosed advanced configuration, auto-expanded for existing data, power mode, or errors.
- Evidence: `HabitScreens.kt`, baseline Habit editor capture, specialist workflow review.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-013 — Settings can persist intermediate numeric and time edits

- Severity/category: P1 configuration correctness.
- Observed: Parseable keystrokes commit immediately, so replacing `300` with `600` can leave `6` or `60`; clock parsing accepts extra segments.
- Expected: Local drafts, strict whole-field validation, and explicit IME/focus commit.
- Evidence: `SettingsScreens.kt` numeric/time setting controls.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-014 — External shared text is unbounded across Activity recreation

- Severity/category: P1 stability and input safety.
- Observed: Arbitrary shared text is retained in Activity state and every additional line may become a subtask.
- Expected: Intent-boundary title/notes/subtask budgets with explicit truncation or refusal feedback.
- Evidence: `MainActivity.kt`, `TaskEditorDialog.kt`.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-015 — Legacy public Goal completion history is omitted from backup

- Severity/category: P1 backup and historical integrity.
- Observed: `goal_completion_snapshots` survives database upgrades but is absent from backup; replace restore deletes it.
- Expected: Meaningful completion history is preserved directly or migrated into the current historical model.
- Evidence: `GoalEntities.kt`, `BackupRepository.kt`, backup tests.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-016 — Abandoned Goals are labeled Completed

- Severity/category: P2 information architecture and historical trust.
- Observed: Completed and Abandoned Goals share the destination labeled Completed.
- Expected: History/Closed organization with truthful Completed and Abandoned distinctions.
- Evidence: `GoalViewModel.kt`, `GoalScreens.kt`.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-017 — Returning users lack a context-recovery path on clear Home

- Severity/category: P2 ADHD and returning-user UX.
- Observed: Existing Inbox, upcoming, paused, recent, or unpinned content can still yield only “Your Day Is Clear.”
- Expected: A compact, nonjudgmental “Pick up where you left off” path distinct from first-run guidance.
- Evidence: `WhipApp.kt` Home clear state.
- Status: Confirmed; remediation pending.

### FND-20260831-018 — Track list query behavior is unreachable

- Severity/category: P2 discoverability and dead state.
- Observed: Track list query/no-match/reorder logic exists but `AllTracksPage` exposes no setter.
- Expected: Purposeful local search or removal of the unreachable branch in favor of explicit global Search routing.
- Evidence: `TrackScreens.kt`.
- Status: Confirmed; product decision pending.

### FND-20260831-019 — Secondary mutation dialogs still dismiss optimistically

- Severity/category: P1 authored-state and interaction integrity.
- Observed: Several draft-bearing or destructive secondary flows still close immediately after dispatching asynchronous work, including Task rescheduling, Habit logging/history/pause actions, Goal measurement/reset actions, and Track/Gym secondary editors or pickers.
- Expected: Any flow whose failure would lose authored input, lie about completion, or make retry ambiguous should use an outcome-aware boundary proportionate to its risk; historical mutations must remain snapshots of what actually happened.
- Why it matters: The definition-editor fix proves the former callback pattern is unsafe, but applying one giant generic coordinator without inspecting each workflow could also add needless friction to quick gym and productivity actions.
- Affected users: Mobile/in-gym users, ADHD users, keyboard users, filtered-Area users, and anyone editing under unreliable storage or lifecycle interruption.
- Evidence: Dispatch-and-dismiss call sites in `WhipApp.kt`, `HabitScreens.kt`, `GoalScreens.kt`, `TrackScreens.kt`, `GymScreens.kt`, and related ViewModels/repositories.
- Recommended solution: Audit each mutation by reversibility, draft cost, historical impact, and latency; reuse the typed request/receipt primitives for authored data, use idempotent optimistic UI only where rollback is explicit and proven, and add focused lifecycle/failure/accessibility regressions before resolving each family.
- Habit sub-resolution: Habit current-total entry, historical log creation/edit/deletion, scheduled-pause creation/edit/deletion, and historical skip undo now use typed request-owned outcomes. Transactional parent checks prevent cross-Habit mutation; exact skip deletion rejects repeated/missing targets; removed log/pause targets remain restorable snapshots until terminal delivery; Home and workspace namespaces cannot steal outcomes; data-generation changes invalidate saved numeric identities; measurement provenance and custom-unit conversions remain authoritative; and binary-noise no-ops use a bounded ULP comparison that preserves real large-value changes. The UI says “Set Today's/This Week's/This Month's Total” and explains that Save sets rather than adds.
- Habit evidence: `HabitRepository.kt`, `HabitDao.kt`, `MeasurementRepository.kt`, `HabitViewModel.kt`, `HabitScreens.kt`, `EntityInspector.kt`, `ProductivityEditorComponents.kt`, `WhipApp.kt`, `HabitRepositoryTest.kt`, `ActivityHistoryUiTest.kt`, `EntitySaveCoordinatorUiTest.kt`, `EntitySaveViewModelIntegrationTest.kt`, and `HabitMutationCommitTest.kt`.
- Status: Partially resolved. The Habit history/pause/absolute-total family is independently accepted and fully verified in `IMP-20260831-009` / `VER-20260831-011`; Task rescheduling, Goal measurement/reset, and remaining Track/Gym secondary flows remain open under this finding.
