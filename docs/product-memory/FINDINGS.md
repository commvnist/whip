# Durable findings

### FND-20260831-001 — Configurable behavior lacked its prerequisite control

- Severity/category: P0 control integrity and domain correctness.
- Observed: Ordinary routines could select `% Training Max` while the required Training Max was hidden or unconfigurable.
- Expected: Every exposed mode has a discoverable, valid path to configure its prerequisites before Save.
- Why it matters: General strength users could create invalid or misleading prescriptions.
- Evidence: `RoutineBuilder.kt`; `RoutineRepository.kt`; detailed evidence in `../GYM_531_PRODUCT_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`.
- Root cause: UI capability and persisted domain requirements evolved separately.
- Resolution: Place Training Max controls before dependent sets, support explicit/derived sources, validate missing estimates, and replace stale child data transactionally.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-002 — Adaptive layout and navigation lost routine context

- Severity/category: P1 mobile UX and navigation.
- Observed: A fixed nested exercise viewport was too small; exercise Save could return to the library root; an early remedy expanded routine content unexpectedly.
- Expected: Editors use available screen/pane space and selection returns to the initiating routine/day.
- Why it matters: Mobile and foldable users could see one exercise at a time and repeatedly reconstruct context.
- Evidence: `WhipApp.kt`, `RoutineBuilder.kt`, `RoutineBuilderUiTest.kt`; screenshots linked by the detailed Gym audit.
- Root cause: The support pane was treated as a generic fixed container and picker navigation did not preserve an explicit return target.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34; subjective device validation remains ongoing.

### FND-20260831-003 — Optional-policy toggles regenerated unrelated prescriptions

- Severity/category: P1 authored-data preservation.
- Observed: Toggling Joker policy could regenerate Main/Supplemental work and overwrite custom details; Joker could appear to compete with ending work.
- Expected: Joker is additive Optional work and cannot mutate BBB/FSL/SSL/BBS/custom Supplemental work.
- Evidence: `RoutineBuilderState.setFiveThreeOneJokerEnabled`; `RoutineBuilderStateTest` additive-preservation regressions.
- Root cause: A broad phase-regeneration path was used for a narrow optional-feature change.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-004 — Rest-timer display could exceed selected duration

- Severity/category: P1 in-gym trust and boundary correctness.
- Observed: A fresh five-minute deadline could render 5:01 before reaching 5:00.
- Expected: Selected duration is an authoritative upper display bound; first elapsed second is 4:59.
- Evidence: Timer calculation tests and the adaptive training section of `../GYM_531_PRODUCT_AUDIT_2026-08-31.md`.
- Root cause: Ceiling deadline arithmetic observed a newer persisted deadline with a stale UI clock tick.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-005 — Active-workout customization could mutate program meaning

- Severity/category: P1 history and progression integrity.
- Observed: Ad-hoc set/exercise additions risked becoming planned Main work or altering the source routine.
- Expected: Workout-only work is explicit Optional/ad-hoc content, persists with the session and history, and leaves future routine prescriptions unchanged.
- Evidence: `GymRepository`, `WhipApp.kt`, `FirstClassWorkflowE2ETest.kt`, repository regressions.
- Root cause: Template prescriptions and session-instance customization were insufficiently separated.
- Status: Verified and released in 0.3.34.

### FND-20260831-006 — Product knowledge was fragmented across chats and dated audits

- Severity/category: P1 process reliability and cross-session continuity.
- Observed: Many useful audit reports existed, but there was no canonical current index, stable issue linkage, or required writeback protocol.
- Expected: Every substantial task begins from and ends by updating concise repository-backed memory, while code remains authoritative.
- Why it matters: Future agents could repeat investigations, forget user corrections, overclaim verification, or regress accepted decisions.
- Root cause: Documentation was report-oriented rather than lifecycle-oriented.
- Resolution: Personal `maintain-whip-memory` skill, workspace instructions, canonical ledgers, stable IDs, and a goal with mandatory memory checkpoints.
- Status: Implemented; effectiveness must be validated through future tasks.
